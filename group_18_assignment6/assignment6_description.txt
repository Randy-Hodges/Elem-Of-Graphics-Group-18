A project description text file, assignment6_description.txt, that summarizes what the intended simulation depicts, what the included classes do,
 and any unexpected challenges. That is, this is mostly a rehash of the progress report but from the position of what you accomplished rather than 
 what you were planning. Also document which group member worked on which part of the assignment. While group coding is allowed, each member is
  responsible for their individual parts -- this ensures all group members are participating and have mastery of the assignment.

Overview: Our code presents an underwater environment with various changing objects.


Minnows (Randy): The Minnow class is responsible for all of the pink fish in the sim. I ended up creating them kind of close to a particle system with 
many different governing forces, specifically a gravity force (towards the center of the screen), a boundary force (to keep fish on screen), and a shark
force to keep fish away from sharks. Most of the forces use the sigmoid function to calculate the magnitude of the force. The fish also change color 
based on how close they get to the sharks. In terms of how things went, they went amazingly well. The code felt pretty clean and natural and the color
of the fish ended up looking even better than what I thought it would. Honestly, I'm really pleased with how it turned out.
