A project description text file, assignment4_description.txt, that summarizes what the intended animation was, what the included classes do, 
and any unexpected challenges. That is, this is mostly a rehash of the progress report but from the position of what you accomplished rather 
than what you were planning. Also document which group member worked on which part of the assignment. While group coding is allowed, each
 member is responsible for their individual parts -- this ensures all group members are participating and have mastery of the assignment.


Overview:
Our project created a scene of cars moving through a city. In our scene there are Cars, Buildings, Birds, and Suns. 


Buildings (Randy):
The intended animation that I was going for was buildings moving across the screen. I used two classes to achieve this- a Building class and a 
Window class. The Building class contains code for the building's body, checking if the building is on screen, and managing Windows. The Window
class contains code for rotating the windows, moving them, and displaying them. One challenge that I faced was that I had originally planned on 
scaling the buildings to meet the project requirements, but I figured that might get messy when trying to keep buildings next to one another, 
so instead I rotated the windows to meet the project requirements.  


Cars (Taylor):


Suns (Hannah):


Birds (Salamone):
