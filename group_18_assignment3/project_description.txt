A project description text file, assignment3_description.txt, that tells us what functionalities you've implemented, other interesting features or 
extra credit within the program, software it relies on that you didn't write, and issues you encountered if there are unresolved problems. This will 
also include documentation of which group member worked on which part of the assignment. While group coding is allowed, each member is responsible for 
individual parts -- this ensures all group members are participating and have mastery of the assignment.
