  1. Classes done are the Score class and Field class. Field may change colors for different themes. 
  Score keeps points up when hitting others. Added functionality to have separate screens for 
  starting game, playing, and end screen of win or lose. Received help with website 
  https://www.toptal.com/game/ultimate-guide-to-processing-simple-game as a skeleton to put our code.
  2. Problems with pausing the game and being able to keep saveState. Didn't add a slider for difficulty
  as I thought I would do. Not as many different menus as I thought would be put.
